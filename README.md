# GotITPracticTESTAngular15

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.0.

1. In "app.ts," we retrieve all shows and save them in the "shows" service. These shows are then stored in corresponding variables: movies$ and series.
2. Additionally, in "app.html," we render the "header," "router-outlet," and "footer" components.
3. When we select a show type, we navigate to a page where we retrieve shows from an observable and have the ability to filter them.
4. The "components" folder contains reusable components, while the "pages" folder contains individual pages. The remaining folders correspond to their respective names.
5. The "hover handle" directive.
6. The "search handle" pipe.
